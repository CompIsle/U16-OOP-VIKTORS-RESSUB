# Unit 16 Object Oriented Progrming A2 - Viktor Salihu


## P3 Produce designs for object-oriented programs to solve different problems, which provide an appropriate solution for the client 

### Todo List
**What are the problems?**
The Todo List programmes aims to help users in successfully organising their tasks. Users have the ability to create tasks, specify task attributes like a title, description, and due date, complete tasks, and view their task list. Users should be able choose between showing all tasks and just incomplete those in the programme.

**Why creating such program is optimal**

+ Task management and organisation: The Todo List programmes offers an organised method to organising and handling tasks. Users can effectively track their progress, prioritise their work, and maintain organisation.


+ Increased Productivity - The Todo List programme offers an organised platform for users to store and track their tasks, helping users remain focused and productive. Users can view their task list, set deadlines, and mark tasks as completed with ease, boosting efficiency and ensuring that crucial tasks are not missed.



**Intended users and their needs**
The application was designed for individuals who want to plan and handle tasks for their personal or professional lives. Students, professionals, domestic workers, or anyone else who needs a digital tool to track their tasks can use it.

**Needs**
Users need a system for centrally planning and categorising their tasks, and they also need a way to monitor their progress and mark completed tasks.




**Constraints** 

As a junior employee, I might only have a small amount of time and money to devote to creating the To-Do List programme. Time management abilities are essential to completing the project on time.

**The flowchart** 

![](TODOLISTFLW.png)


**Graphical User Interface**

![](todogui.png)



**Usability and intuitive user interaction.**

The user interface of the Todo List programme should be simple to understand and navigate. An organised task list, simple icons, and clear labels all contribute to an easy-to-use interface. Common task management operations like deleting tasks, marking tasks as complete, and updating task details should be simple for users to complete. These actions can be facilitated by buttons or menus that are easy to understand.




### College Library Index System

**What are the problems?**
By including them in a new index system, the library book index system aims to assist a college library in organising its books. The programme must create distinct index references for each book by reading the book's information (title, author, publisher, and publication date) from a saved CSV file. A new CSV file should be created and added to it with the generated index references and the other book information. In order to support future implementations using different approaches, the programme should also include a separate class that is in charge of allocating serial numbers through the implementation of an interface.

**Why creating such program is optimal**

+ Book organisation that is effective: The Library Book Index System makes it easier to add books to the library's index. By automatically extracting book information from a CSV file and generating distinct index references for each book, it does away with manual data entry and reduces errors.

+ Quick and Simple Information Retrieval: Using the generated index references, the Library Book Index System enables library staff to quickly locate books. It offers a standardised method to recognise and retrieve book information, simplifying the process of looking for books.

+ Better book tracking and management: The library can more efficiently track and manage its book collection by implementing an indexing system. The index system simplifies library management by making it simple to keep track of a book's availability, circulation history, and overdue status.

**Intended users and their needs**
Those in charge of overseeing and organising the library's book collection, such as librarians, are the system's primary target audience. They take care of book purchases, cataloguing, and keeping precise records of the library's stock.

**Needs**

The college might only have a finite amount of money and time to devote to creating the library index reference system. For a timely completion, effective planning and resource management are required.


**The flowchart** 

![](LIBRARYFLOWCHART.png)


**Usability and intuitive user interaction.**

Reading book details and creating index references should be automated by the Library Book Index System. Users should be able to import book data from a CSV file without manually entering the information, which will save time and minimise mistakes. To avoid inaccurate data entry or inconsistent book details, the programme should have error handling and validation mechanisms. Users can be directed to provide accurate information by way of user-friendly error messages and input validation.

## P5 Produce object-oriented programs and graphical user interface solutions that meet program designs 

### **TO-DO LIST:**


### Object-oriented principle

+ **Encapsulation**: By encapsulating the task-related information and actions within the TaskItem class, the Todo List programme illustrates encapsulation. The class contains the getter and setter methods for properties like Title, Description, DueDate, and Completed. Data abstraction is facilitated by encapsulation, which also safeguards the internal state of the tasks.

+ **Inheritance:** Although it isn't mentioned in the programme, inheritance can be used to increase the functionality of the TaskItem class in the Todo List programme. Future task types, such as recurring tasks or subtasks, could be descended from the base TaskItem class, inheriting its properties and methods while incorporating particular functionality.

+ **Polymorphism:** When dealing with various tasks, the Todo List programme can use polymorphism. Polymorphism enables the programme to handle various tasks uniformly by establishing a standard interface or base class for tasks and implementing particular behaviour for each task type. The programme might define functions like AddTask and DeleteTask, for instance, which can accept various task types and take the appropriate actions.

+ **Method Overloading/Overriding:** Method overloading is a technique that the Todo List programme can use to provide multiple versions of methods with various parameter lists. For instance, different iterations of the AddTask method may accept various sets of parameters, enabling users to add tasks of various granularities. On the other hand, when specialised task types are derived from the base TaskItem class, method overriding can be used to enable them to override and provide their own implementation for specific methods.



### Data types, variables, constants, arithmetic and logical operators, subroutines

Data types:

1. String: Used to store task titles, descriptions, and other text-based data.
2. DateTime: Used to store task due dates.

Variables:

+ `tasks`: Stores a collection of TaskItem objects representing tasks.
+ `showIncompleteTasks`: Stores a boolean value indicating whether to show only incomplete tasks.
+ `selectedFilter`: Stores the selected filter option for task display.

Constants:

+ None explicitly defined in the provided code.


Arithmetic and Logical Operators:

+ No explicit arithmetic or logical operators are used in the given code. However, these operators can be utilized for calculations and logical comparisons within the program's logic.


Subroutines:

+ ``AddTask_Click()``: Adds a new task to the task list.
+ ``DeleteTask_Click()``: Deletes a task from the task list.
+ ``MarkAsComplete_Click()``: Marks a task as complete.
+ ``ApplyFilter()``: Applies the selected filter option to display tasks.
+ ``UpdateTaskList()``: Updates the task list based on changes made.

### **College Index Refrencing Library:**

### Object-oriented principle

+ **Encapsulation:** The Book and BookWithID classes in the Library Book Index System serve as an example of encapsulation by containing all information and functions related to books. These classes include getter and setter methods in addition to properties like Title, Author, Publisher, and PublicationDate. In order to ensure that the internal workings of the book objects are contained within the classes, encapsulation aids in data hiding and abstraction.

+ **Inheritance:** The BookWithID class is descended from the base Book class by means of inheritance in the Library Book Index System. The BookWithID class adds an additional ID property to represent the distinct index reference while inheriting the Book class's properties and behaviour. The ability to specialise book objects is made possible by inheritance, which also encourages modularity and code reuse.

+ **Polymorphism:** When managing various book-related operations, the Library Book Index System can make use of polymorphism. Polymorphism enables the programme to treat various book objects uniformly by defining a common interface or base class for books and implementing unique behaviour for each type of book. This adaptability enables extensibility in handling various book types or applying various indexing strategies.

+ **Method Overloading/Overriding:** The Library Book Index System can implement various iterations of methods with various parameter lists by using a technique called method overloading. For instance, various book collections or various approaches to producing distinctive IDs may be accepted by various iterations of the GenerateIDs method. Method overriding can be used to increase the functionality of the Book class or to provide specific implementations for methods in derived classes.





### Data types, variables, constants, arithmetic and logical operators, subroutines

Data Types:

1. String: Used to store book titles, authors, publishers, and other text-based data.

+ `idMap`: Stores a dictionary mapping books to their generated index references.

Constants:

+ `inputFilePath`: Stores the constant path to the input CSV file.
+ `outputFilePath`: Stores the constant path to the output CSV file.


Arithmetic and Logical Operators:

No explicit arithmetic or logical operators are used in the given code. However, these operators can be utilized for calculations and logical comparisons within the program's logic.


Subroutines:

+ `ReadBooksFromCSV()`: Reads book details from the input CSV file.
+ `GenerateIDs()`: Generates unique index references for books.
+ `WriteBooksToCSV()`: Writes books with index references to the output CSV file.
