# ConsoleApp - CSV Processor

This console application reads data from an input CSV file, generates unique IDs for each record, and writes the processed data with IDs to an output CSV file. The application uses relative file paths, allowing it to be used on different machines without needing to change the path.

## Usage

1. Ensure that the input CSV file (`input.csv`) is located inVIKTOR_S_U16A2-main\Application_2_IndexRef\IndexRef\bin\Debug\net6.0 directory.

2. Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where the compiled executable file (`ConsoleApp.exe`) is located.

3. Run the application by executing the following command:

   


        ConsoleApp.exe


## Output Path
    
    VIKTOR_S_U16A2-main\Application_2_IndexRef\IndexRef\bin\Debug
